Category Management System
This application is designed to manage hierarchical data, it allows users to create, organize, and display categories and their subcategories in a tree structure. 
It uses a tree data structure to organize and manipulate categories, where each category can have subcategories, forming a parent-child relationship. 
This type of application could be used in a variety of real-world scenarios, such as organizing products in an online store, managing files in a directory
structure, or categorizing content for a knowledge management system.
What can it do?
You can add subcategories under an existing parent category, thereby expanding the category tree.
Display Categories, it shows the full hierarchical tree structure, visually indicating the parent-child relationships
using indentation.
And dynamic, the application can continue to add categories and view the tree during its runtime until the user decides to exit.
I make this simple console application is to know how to create and practice several fundamental concepts in programming.
How does it contribute to me or to the community, this kind of application is highly relevant to anyone learning how to manage 
hierarchical data. It can be expanded and used in a variety of contexts.
Inventory or Product Management, the application could be adapted to manage categories of products in a store.
In conclusion, this Category Manager Application is a great way to showcase basic tree data structures and recursion. It provides value by helping 
organize data into categories, which can be applied across various domains like tree data structure, recursion, and working with hierarchical data, while also being adaptable 
to real-world applications.
